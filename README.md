# Local Weather App

This is a web based weather app that gets the user's geolocation and makes a call to a weather api to get data about the current weather. The user can toggle between imperial metric units by clicking on the temperature or the wind speed. Also depending on the current forecast the SVG icons will change to mirror the weather conditions.

## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanjmack.github.io/fcc-local-weather/)!

## Built With

* HTML/SCSS
* ES6 JavaScript
* Gulp for automating tasks
* Babel for converting ES6 to ES5
* No JS or CSS libraries

## Objectives
This project is one of the intermediate front end projects for freeCodeCamp.

The three user stories that must be fulfilled are:
1. User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

2. User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

3. User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
